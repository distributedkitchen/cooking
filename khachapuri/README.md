# Ajarian or Acharuli Khachapuri

*This makes 2 rather large khachapuri.*

## Ingredients

###Dough:
* 1.15 kilos of flour (8-9 cups)
* 200 ml of water (just over ¾ of a cup)
* 200 ml of milk (just over ¾ of a cup)
* 1 egg
* 1 Tbs of yeast
* 50 ml of olive oil (around ¼ of a cup)
* 1 tsp sugar

###Filling:
* 8oz feta
* 8oz mozzarella
* 8oz muenster
* 3-8 Tbs butter
* 3 eggs

## Steps

1. Warm just over ¾ cup of water (not boiling, just warm) and stir in yeast.
2. Add 8 cups of flour to a mixing bowl and make a depression in the flour.
3. Add the yeast water, ¼ cup of oil, just over ¾ cup of milk, egg, and 1 tsp of sugar to the flour.  
4. Mix the ingredients from the middle of the bowl until all of the flour is mixed.  You can add tiny amounts of water if the mixture is too dry.
5. Form the dough into a soft ball in the bowl
6. Cover the bowl with cling film and leave in a warm place for at least two hours.  The dough should rise to just under double its size.
7. Pre-heat oven to 500 degrees F – with pizza stone inside oven.
8. Add about half a cup to a cup of flour to the dough and sprinkle some flour on kneading surface to keep dough from sticking, and knead the dough for a few minutes.  Separate dough into two portions to make two rather large khachapuri.
9. Grate all the cheese together.  Add 2-3 tablespoons of butter, broken into small pieces into the cheese and mix all together.
10. Knead the dough a little again before using. Leave for 10 minutes and then make a flattish boat shape.
11. Spread the cheese and butter filling into the center of the dough leaving 2-3 inches bare near the edges.
12. Fold or roll the edges in on all sides and together at the ends to make the boat shape and contain the cheese.
13. Separate one egg yolk and stir in a dish.  Use to glaze the khachapuri.
14. Put the khachapuri on parchment paper and put on heated pizza stone.
15. Bake for approximately 12-14 minutes.
16. Pull out khachapuri and add one raw egg to the cheese.
17. Put back in oven and bake for 3-5 more minutes.
18. Pull out.  Let rest a few minutes.  Add a tablespoon or more butter into cheese and egg mixture.  Mix together butter and egg and eat with little pieces of the bread part of the khachapuri.

## Notes:
After the dough was done rising, I think I only added like a quarter cup of flour directly to the dough – the dough was already pretty dry.  Most of the flour went to sprinkling the table top.  Also, I have no idea how much cheese I actually used.  This is a rough guess.  It might be too much?
